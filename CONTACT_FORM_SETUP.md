# ðŸ“§ Contact Form Setup Instructions

Your contact form is ready and just needs EmailJS configuration to work. Follow these steps:

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Get EmailJS Account

- Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- Sign up for FREE (no credit card required)
- Verify your email

### 2. Add Email Service

**IMPORTANT: Gmail API Scope Fix**

- Dashboard â†’ Email Services â†’ Add New Service
- Choose your email provider (Gmail recommended)
- **When connecting Gmail, make sure to:**
  1. Click "Advanced" if you see a warning
  2. Allow ALL permissions requested (including "Send email on your behalf")
  3. If you get "insufficient authentication scopes" error:
     - Go back to Email Services
     - Delete the Gmail service
     - Add it again and grant ALL permissions
- Connect your `info@enkisoma.org` email
- Copy the **Service ID** (looks like: `service_abc123`)

**Alternative Email Services (if Gmail issues persist):**

- Outlook/Hotmail (often easier setup)
- Yahoo Mail
- Custom SMTP (advanced users)

### 3. Create Email Template

- Dashboard â†’ Email Templates â†’ Create New Template
- Template Name: `enkisoma_contact`
- Subject: `New Contact from {{name}} - Enkisoma Website`
- Content:

```
New message from Enkisoma website:

Name: {{name}}
Email: {{email}}
School: {{school}}

Message:
{{message}}

Reply to: {{email}}
```

- Save and copy the **Template ID** (looks like: `template_xyz789`)

### 4. Get Public Key

- Dashboard â†’ Account â†’ General
- Copy your **Public Key** (looks like: `user_abcdefghijk123`)

### 5. Update Website Code

Open `index.html` and find these 3 lines around line 3569:

**Line ~3569:** Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`

```javascript
emailjs.init("user_YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY");
```

**Line ~3594:** Replace both IDs

```javascript
emailjs.send("service_YOUR_SERVICE_ID", "template_YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID", formData);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Configuration

```javascript
// Example of what your final code should look like:
emailjs.init("user_abcd1234567890");
emailjs.send("service_gmail", "template_contact", formData);
```

## âœ… Testing

1. Save the file
2. Open website in browser
3. Fill out contact form
4. Submit - you should receive email at info@enkisoma.org

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Gmail API "insufficient authentication scopes" error?**

1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard â†’ Email Services
2. Delete your Gmail service
3. Add Gmail service again
4. When authorizing, click "Advanced" â†’ "Go to EmailJS (unsafe)"
5. Grant ALL permissions including "Send email on your behalf"
6. Test again

**Form not sending?**

- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify all 3 IDs are correct (no quotes missing)
- Make sure EmailJS service is connected

**Not receiving emails?**

- Check spam folder
- Verify template variables match: `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{school}}`, `{{message}}`
- Test EmailJS template directly in dashboard

**EmailJS fails completely?**

- The form has a built-in fallback that opens the user's email client
- They can still send emails manually to info@enkisoma.org
